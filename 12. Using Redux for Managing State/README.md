# Redux Implementation in Practice Projects

This documentation outlines the implementation of Redux in a series of practice projects. Each project focuses on different aspects of Redux, including slices, actions, reducers, and the store configuration. Additionally, React components integrate with Redux to manage application state effectively.

## Project Structure

### 1. Auth Slice

**Purpose:** Manages authentication state.

**Actions:**
- login: Sets isAuthenticated to true when a user logs in.
- logout: Sets isAuthenticated to false when a user logs out.

### 2. Counter Slice

**Purpose:** Manages the counter state.

**Actions:**
- increment: Increments the counter value by 1.
- decrement: Decrements the counter value by 1.
- increase: Increases the counter value by a specified amount.
- toggleCounter: Toggles the visibility of the counter.

### 3. Store Configuration

**Purpose:** Configures the Redux store with combined reducers.

**Reducers:**
- counterReducer: Handles counter-related state changes.
- authReducer: Handles authentication-related state changes.

### 4. React Components

- **Header Component:** Renders the application header and handles user authentication.
- **Auth Component:** Renders the authentication form and dispatches authentication actions.
- **Counter Component:** Renders the counter UI and controls, dispatches counter actions.
- **UserProfile Component:** Renders user profile information.

## Key Concepts and Features

- **Redux Toolkit:** Utilizes createSlice and configureStore for simplified Redux setup.
- **Dispatching Actions:** Dispatches actions using useDispatch hook.
- **State Selection:** Selects state using useSelector hook.
- **Integration with React Components:** Integrates Redux with React components to manage application state.
