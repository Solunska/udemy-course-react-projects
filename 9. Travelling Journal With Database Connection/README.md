# Project Documentation: Traveling Journal App with Database Connection

## Overview
This project builds on a previous traveling journal app by adding database connectivity and utilizing custom React hooks. The new functionality includes sending HTTP requests, data fetching, using async/await, handling loading states, handling HTTP errors, transforming fetched data, and performing GET, POST, and PUT requests. Additionally, it introduces custom hooks for managing state and making the code more modular and reusable.

## Project Structure
- **AvailablePlaces Component:** Fetches and displays available places, handling loading and error states using a custom hook.
- **App Component:**  Manages user places, handles data fetching, updating, and UI state using a custom hook.
- **Places Component:** Displays a list of places.
- **Error Component:** Displays error messages.
- **Modal Component:** Shows modals for confirming deletions and displaying errors.
- **DeleteConfirmation Component:** Handles confirmation of place deletions.
- **useFetch Custom Hook:** Handles data fetching, loading state, and error management for both AvailablePlaces and App components.
