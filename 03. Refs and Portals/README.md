# Project Documentation: Task Manager App with Refs and Portals

## Overview
This project involves building a task manager app using React. The key focus areas include managing user input with state and refs, utilizing portals for modal dialogs, implementing two-way data binding, and sharing state across components.

## Project Structure
- **Player Component:** Manages user input using refs and state.
- **ResultModal Component:** Displays results using portals and forward refs.
- **TimerChallenge Component:** Implements a timer challenge with start, stop, and reset functionality.
- **App Component:** Combines all components and manages the overall structure.

## Key Learnings and Concepts Practiced
- **Refs and Portals:** Using refs to manage DOM elements and portals to render components outside the main DOM hierarchy.
- **Managing User Input with State:** Implementing two-way data binding to keep the UI and state in sync.
- **Fragments:** Using fragments to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
- **Forwarding Refs:** Passing refs to child components to control their DOM elements.
- **Sharing State Across Components:** Prop drilling and using hooks to share and manage state across different components.
